Checking if there are changes when exiting doesn't work.

Changing the case file doesn't cause the document to reload in the occurrence documents.

Add offender history.

Handle scrolling in facts of charge

Sometimes when the left column has too much content (maybe this is the reason?) the UI goes weird. Need to do testing
on screens that are the size of the work laptops

Add colour coding for whether notes have been added to the case file

Options for storing court lists:
1. Single court list stored in a local database
2. Multiple court lists stored in a local database, locatable by date and court room - there will need to be a way to
   select which court list to use
3. Court lists both stored in a local database and able to be exported to a file to enable sharing

Chose option 3.

Currently working on having multiple defendants in the database with the same ID. It it probably unnecessary for this to be a relevant consideration
and the ID can be a GUID to avoid collisions. They will not need to know about one another from list to list.

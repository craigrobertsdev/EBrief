FUNCTIONALITY:
	- Checking if there are changes when exiting doesn't work.
	- Changing the case file doesn't cause the document to reload in the occurrence documents.
	- Test that the court lists load correctly when moving between lists
	- Properly implement functionality to export court lists to a file
	- Implement functionality to import court lists from a file
	- Handle situations where there already exists a court list with the corresponding date, courtCode and courtRoom
	- Work out logging
	- Sometimes when loading a court list, possibly where there are too many case files for a single defendant, the case files render
	  as a row of extremely tall elements that push the buttons to the side, off the screen.

STYLING:
	- Handle scrolling in facts of charge
	- Add colour coding for whether notes have been added to the case file
	- Sometimes when the left column has too much content (maybe this is the reason?) the UI goes weird. Need to do testing
	on screens that are the size of the work laptops
	- Handle long defendant names, maybe by truncating them and adding tooltip
	- Work out why sometimes when there are a large number of case files the size of the top row is enormous
	- Move buttons to a different location. I'm thinking toaster menu

DECISION LOG:
	Options for storing court lists:
	1. Single court list stored in a local database
	2. Multiple court lists stored in a local database, locatable by date and court room - there will need to be a way to
	   select which court list to use
	3. Multiple court lists both stored in a local database and able to be exported to a file to enable sharing

	Chose option 3.

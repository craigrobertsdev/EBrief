FUNCTIONALITY:
	- Checking if there are changes when exiting doesn't work.
	- Changing the case file doesn't cause the document to reload in the occurrence documents.
	- Test that the court lists load correctly when moving between lists
	- Properly implement functionality to export court lists to a file
	- Implement functionality to import court lists from a file
	- Work out logging
	- Search function for case files by either case file or courtfile number
	- Tooltip to be added to case files on hover to give information about the charge names or other details
		- When changing defendants the next tooltip throws a null reference exception. This looks to be due to the lack of elements being 
		linked to the ElementReference list beyond the first defendant on load.
		Got to work out a way to make these elements link to the ElementReference list on changing defendant
	- Order case files by first offence date

STYLING:
	- Add colour coding for whether notes have been added to the case file

DECISION LOG:
	Options for storing court lists:
	1. Single court list stored in a local database
	2. Multiple court lists stored in a local database, locatable by date and court room - there will need to be a way to
	   select which court list to use
	3. Multiple court lists both stored in a local database and able to be exported to a file to enable sharing

	Chose option 3.

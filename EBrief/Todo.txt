DECISION LOG:
	Options for storing court lists:
	1. Single court list stored in a local database
	2. Multiple court lists stored in a local database, locatable by date and court room - there will need to be a way to
	   select which court list to use
	3. Multiple court lists both stored in a local database and able to be exported to a file to enable sharing

	Chose option 3.
